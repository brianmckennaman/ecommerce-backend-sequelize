# ecommerce-backend-sequelize

The purpose of this assingment was to create a functional backend server for a hypothetical ecommerce database.

First, I cloned that starter code and refactored and added in the necessary values for the models and routes, and installed the necessary node packages.

Then, I successfully tested each of the routes using Insomnia.
